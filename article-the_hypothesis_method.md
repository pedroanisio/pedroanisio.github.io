# The Hypothesis Method: A Formal Framework

## Core Principle
Transform intuitive insights into validated knowledge through systematic investigation and iterative refinement.

## Phase 1: Intuition Capture
**Objective:** Document pre-verbal insights and pattern recognition

### 1.1 Initial Observation
- Record the triggering context (when/where the feeling arose)
- Note the feeling's characteristics:
  - Strength (subtle hint → strong conviction)
  - Domain (personal, professional, theoretical, empirical)
  - Valence (something's wrong, something's possible, something's connected)

### 1.2 Articulation Attempt
- Write stream-of-consciousness descriptions
- Use metaphors or analogies if direct description is difficult
- Document what the feeling is NOT (boundary definition)

## Phase 2: Hypothesis Formation
**Objective:** Convert intuition into testable proposition

### 2.1 Statement Construction
Format: "If [condition], then [expected outcome], because [mechanism]"
- **Condition:** The circumstances under which you expect something to occur
- **Outcome:** Observable/measurable prediction
- **Mechanism:** Your theory of WHY this relationship exists

### 2.2 Assumption Identification
List all implicit assumptions that must be true for your hypothesis to hold:
- Environmental assumptions
- Causal assumptions  
- Definitional assumptions

## Phase 3: Investigation Protocol
**Objective:** Rigorously test the hypothesis

### 3.1 Falsification Priority
Design tests that could DISPROVE your hypothesis:
- What evidence would make you abandon this hypothesis?
- What's the strongest counter-argument?
- What alternative explanations exist?

### 3.2 Validation Criteria
Define what constitutes support:
- Minimum evidence threshold
- Required consistency across contexts
- Statistical or logical standards

### 3.3 Research Execution
- **Literature review:** Has this been tested before?
- **Data collection:** Gather relevant evidence
- **Experimentation:** Design controlled tests where possible
- **Expert consultation:** Seek informed critiques

## Phase 4: Hypothesis Evolution
**Objective:** Refine understanding based on evidence

### 4.1 Evidence Integration
- Categorize findings:
  - Supporting evidence
  - Contradicting evidence  
  - Orthogonal discoveries (unexpected related findings)

### 4.2 Reformulation Decision Tree
```
IF evidence strongly contradicts core mechanism:
    → Abandon or fundamentally restructure hypothesis
ELSE IF evidence contradicts specific predictions:
    → Modify scope or conditions
ELSE IF evidence supports with caveats:
    → Add boundary conditions or moderating variables
ELSE IF evidence fully supports:
    → Seek edge cases and extend applications
```

### 4.3 Version Documentation
- Hypothesis v1.0: [Original statement]
- Hypothesis v1.1: [Refined statement] | Changed because: [reason]
- Continue versioning with changelog

## Phase 5: Knowledge Integration
**Objective:** Connect validated hypothesis to broader understanding

### 5.1 Theoretical Integration
- How does this fit with established knowledge?
- What existing theories does it challenge or support?
- What new questions does it raise?

### 5.2 Practical Applications
- Where can this insight be applied?
- What decisions does it inform?
- What predictions can now be made?

## Meta-Process Controls

### Quality Checks
- **Coherence:** Is the hypothesis internally consistent?
- **Parsimony:** Is this the simplest explanation?
- **Scope:** Are you claiming too much or too little?
- **Testability:** Can this actually be proven wrong?

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Feeling fixation:** Becoming attached to the original intuition despite evidence
2. **Premature formalization:** Jumping to hypothesis before fully exploring the intuition
3. **Confirmation bias:** Only seeking supporting evidence
4. **Scope creep:** Expanding hypothesis beyond what evidence supports
5. **Abandonment threshold:** Not defining when to give up on a hypothesis

## Recursive Application
This method can be applied to itself: If you have a "feeling" that the method needs adjustment, formulate that as a hypothesis about methodology and test it through application.
